# Pokedex - A React/Redux API Project

This project is an updated version of my previous Pokedex / React project, which you can see [here](https://github.com/andrews1022/pokedex-react). With this iteration, I wanted to add features I felt were missing, as well as improve how state was managed.

### Some of the features I'll be adding are:

- Simple toolbar allowing the user to quickly view Pokemon from different regions
- Add evolution chains and prev/next arrows when viewing individual Pokemon
- Search bar where the user can manually search for a specific Pokemon
- Update loading animations
- Use CSS Grid for layout instead of Flexbox
- Using Axios for fetching data from the API instead of the fetch API
- Using Redux for state management
- Using Node-Sass to import SCSS modules
